# Analyzing EPA beach action data

Data pulled from [BEACON](https://watersgeo.epa.gov/BEACON2/reports.html) and used to analyze beaches with the most actions, advisories and closures, along with sources and reasons. 

We specifically used the following reports from BEACON: 

-Beach Actions (Advisories and Closures) 
-Beach Profile 
-State Summary
